Summary
=======

This collection has lots of simple tools for transport and reactor 
problems.  Its purpose is to be easy to use and easy to extend.  MATLAB's
object-oriented features are heavily used, sometimes at the cost of 
some efficiency.  However, this is *not* a performance code but rather
one for illustrating various algorithms.
